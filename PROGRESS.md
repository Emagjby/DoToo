## Recent Achievements

### Calendar View Drag and Drop (Latest Update)
Implemented comprehensive drag and drop functionality in the calendar view:

**Features Added:**
- **Draggable Tasks**: Each task in the calendar now has a grip handle that appears on hover
- **Droppable Calendar Days**: Calendar days act as drop zones with visual feedback
- **Date Updates**: Dropping a task on a different date automatically updates its due date
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Hover effects on drop zones
  - Drag overlay showing task preview
  - Opacity changes during drag operations
  - Ring indicators on valid drop targets
- **UX Improvements**:
  - Grip handles only appear on hover to maintain clean design
  - Drag activation requires minimum distance to prevent accidental drags
  - Visual indicators in status legend explaining drag functionality
  - Console feedback for successful task moves

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses same @dnd-kit library as Kanban board for consistency
- DraggableTaskCard component with useDraggable hook
- DroppableCalendarDay component with useDroppable hook
- Proper TypeScript typing for drag events
- Integration with existing task update system
- Maintains all existing calendar functionality

This enhancement makes the calendar view significantly more interactive and user-friendly, allowing for quick date adjustments through intuitive drag and drop interactions.
